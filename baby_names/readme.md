# ðŸ‘¶ Baby Names SQL Project

This project is based on a publicly available **Baby Names dataset** from the [U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA)](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) and a set of **custom SQL practice questions** designed for analysis.  
The goal of this project was to explore SQL querying in **PostgreSQL 17**, covering tasks from basic filtering to advanced analytical queries.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Dataset**: U.S. Baby Names dataset (contains yearly baby name records from 1880 onwards, with counts and gender classification).
- **Question Source**: A custom set of SQL challenges created for practice.
- **Structure**: Queries are organized into **three levels** of complexity:
  1. **[Easy Level](https://github.com/TimurMMD/SQL_projects/blob/main/baby_names_project/easy_set.sql)** â€“ Basic `SELECT`, filtering, and ordering.
  2. **[Moderate Level](https://github.com/TimurMMD/SQL_projects/blob/main/baby_names_project/moderate_set.sql)** â€“ Aggregations, grouping, and simple joins.
  3. **[Advanced Level](https://github.com/TimurMMD/SQL_projects/blob/main/baby_names_project/advance_set.sql)** â€“ Window functions, CTEs, and complex subqueries.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **PostgreSQL 17** â€“ SQL execution environment.
  - **pgAdmin** â€“ Database management and execution.
  - **Excel** â€“ Used to preprocess and check CSV files before importing into PostgreSQL.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TimurMMD/SQL_projects.git
2. **Load the dataset into PostgreSQL using pgAdmin.**

3. **Open the SQL scripts for each difficulty level**:

- Easy Queries

- Moderate Queries

- Advanced Queries

4. **Run queries level-by-level and explore the results.**

ðŸ“– Learning Focus
This project helps reinforce:

- Data filtering and sorting

- Using different types of joins

- Aggregation and grouping

- Working with subqueries and CTEs
