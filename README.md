# 📊 SQL Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **SQL Projects Portfolio**!  
This repository contains a collection of SQL projects that I’ve worked on to practice and demonstrate database querying, data analysis, and problem-solving skills.  
Each project is based on real or publicly available datasets and covers various levels of complexity — from beginner queries to advanced SQL techniques.
