# ðŸŽµ Music Store SQL Project

This project is based on a publicly available **Music Store dataset** and an **external set of SQL practice questions** ([Original Question Source](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) and adapted exercise set).  
The goal of this project was to practice SQL querying skills in **PostgreSQL 17**, covering different levels of complexity.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Publicly available Music Store database (contains information about customers, invoices, artists, albums, tracks, employees, etc.).
- **Question Source**: An external set of SQL challenges (linked above).
- **Structure**: Queries are organized into **three levels** of increasing difficulty:
  1. **[Easy Level](https://github.com/TimurMMD/SQL_projects/blob/main/music_store_project/easy_set.sql)** â€“ Basic `SELECT`, `WHERE`, filtering, and sorting.
  2. **[Moderate Level](https://github.com/TimurMMD/SQL_projects/blob/main/music_store_project/moderate_set.sql)** â€“ Aggregations, joins, and grouping.
  3. **[Advanced Level](https://github.com/TimurMMD/SQL_projects/blob/main/music_store_project/advance_set.sql)** â€“ Subqueries, CTEs, and analytical functions.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **PostgreSQL 17** â€“ SQL execution environment.
  - **pgAdmin** â€“ Database management interface.
  - **Excel** â€“ Used as a CSV container to check and prepare data before loading into PostgreSQL.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TimurMMD/SQL_projects.git

2. **Load the dataset into PostgreSQL using pgAdmin.**

3. **Open the SQL scripts for each difficulty level**:

- Easy Queries

- Moderate Queries

- Advanced Queries

4. **Run queries level-by-level and explore the results.**

ðŸ“– Learning Focus
This project helps reinforce:

- Data filtering and sorting

- Using different types of joins
